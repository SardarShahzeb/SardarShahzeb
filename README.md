üå± Current Work: I'm a React and Web 3.0 developer, diving deep into the world of decentralized applications (dApps).

‚öíÔ∏è Collaboration: I'm open to collaborating on React.js and Web 3.0 projects, utilizing modern web technologies to build cutting-edge solutions.

**About Me:**
I'm a dedicated developer with a strong focus on front-end technologies, especially React.js and Web 3.0. I enjoy creating user-friendly, interactive interfaces that deliver seamless experiences. I‚Äôm also deeply fascinated by blockchain technology and its potential to transform various industries.

### Experience
I have over 5 years of expertise in seamlessly blending design, development, and captivating imagery. I've mastered the art of crafting _reusable email components_, _building mobile-responsive campaigns_, and _designing impactful digital ads_ for content creation.

Let's connect and explore how I can bring my unique blend of skills to your team.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects & Work
Dao:- Tomi DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on building decentralized infrastructure for Ethereum. It governs Tomi products and function to be perfomred, a blockchain optimized for secure and transparent governance. 

tDNS:- tomi Domain Name System: tDNS enhances security and accessibility for blockchain-based domain naming, similar to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). It leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide tamper-proof records and enables easy creation of ".tomi" and ".com" domains, offering a secure, user-friendly naming solution for the Ethereum ecosystem.

DOP:- Data Ownership Protocol: DOP uses zero-knowledge roll-ups to move computation and state storage off-chain, boosting Ethereum Mainnet‚Äôs throughput while ensuring complete data ownership. With zero-knowledge proofs, DOP reduces transaction costs and allows secure interaction with Layer 1 apps.

Wizard Gallery NFT Marketplace:- A specialized NFT marketplace for buying, selling, and owning NFTs within the Core ecosystem.

Staking:- Tomi Staking is a feature within the Tomi ecosystem that allows users to stake their $TOMI tokens in exchange for rewards and governance participation. By staking $TOMI, users contribute to the security and stability of the Tomi decentralized infrastructure, such as the tomiDAO and other blockchain-based services like the tDNS (tomi Domain Name System)

launchpad:- platform designed to help new blockchain projects raise funds and launch their tokens to the public. It provides a space for projects to conduct Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs), or similar token sales, giving investors early access to new cryptocurrencies before they are widely available.
